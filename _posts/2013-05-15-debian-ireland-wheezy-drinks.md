Thanks to Federico the
[Debian Irish User Group](http://lists.debian.org/debian-dug-ie/)
celebrates the Wheezy release with some pints this Friday (17.05.2013) at 8
at Mac Turcaill's. For more information and a link to the pub have a
look at the
[mailing list posting from Federico](http://lists.debian.org/debian-dug-ie/2013/05/msg00002.html).

Oh and by the way: the Irish Debian Community officially launched last
year, i.e. `debian-dug-ie` is `#newinwheezy`.
